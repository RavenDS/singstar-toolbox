# Singstar PS2 Toolbox
A Custom Disc Creator for Singstar PS2. 

## Setup
##### Download the latest version of ffmpeg.exe <a href="https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z">(direct link for Win10)</a> and place it in the same folder as Singstar Toolbox.
##### After the initial setup, do NOT move or edit any files in /tools/ folder, as this may lead to data corruption.

## Features
- Re-encode all .txt with UTF-8 & fix line breaks
- Audio normalization for consistent volume
- Entirely rewritten TXT to XML converter
- Create Medleys automatically
- Pack & Unpack Singstar .PAK files
- ISO is compatible with emulators & real hardware *(tested on PCSX2 and PS3)*

## To-Do List & Limitations
*The current limitations and to-do list will evolve as the tool is being worked on.*

- <b>Duet (2 players singing at different times) is currently broken, never was compatible with the old Singstar Creator. This will be fixed soon. Avoid .TXTs marked as [MULTI].</b>
- A few videos (6 out of 120 during testing) freeze on the first frame after conversion. Use another input video if needed. Audio playback & lyrics are not affected.
- MP3s with extremely low bitrates (64-32kbps) may have issues during the resampling process. 
- *TODO:* Reverse-engineer newer Singstar versions for Rap support
- *TODO:* Finish rewriting the TXT2XML converter to accomodate for Rap notes and multiple singers *(Duet)*
- *TODO:* Multiple language support (currently only English)
- *TODO:* Rewrite the BMP to TX2 algorithm for better image quality
- *TODO:* Improve the audio conversion algorithm to get rid of MFAudio
- *TODO:* Let user customize Intros, Logos, Menu Music..

## Credits

## Notes
It is possible to add more than 60 songs to a single disc, however the game might crash because of the excessive amount of artworks in menu.
