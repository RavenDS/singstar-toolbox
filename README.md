# Singstar PS2 Toolbox
A Custom Disc Creator for Singstar PS2. 

## Setup
##### Download the latest version of ffmpeg.exe <a href="https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z">(direct link for Win10)</a> and place it in the same folder as Singstar Toolbox.
##### RavenXML converter is selected by default. If lyrics are not converting properly, you can try switching to the deprecated TXT2XML from the 'XML converter' tab.
##### After the initial setup, <u>DO NOT</u> move or edit any files in /tools/ folder, as this will lead to malfunctions & data corruption.

## Features
- Re-encode all .txt with UTF-8 & fix line breaks
- Audio normalization for consistent volume
- Entirely rewritten TXT to XML converter
- Create Medleys automatically
- Pack & Unpack Singstar .PAK files
- ISO is compatible with emulators & real hardware *(tested on PCSX2 and PS3)*

## To-Do List & Limitations
*The current limitations and to-do list will evolve as the tool is being worked on.*<br />
*TODOs are sorted by priority.*

- A few videos (6 out of 120 during testing) freeze on the first frame after conversion. Use another input video if needed. Audio playback & lyrics are not affected.
- MP3s with extremely low bitrates (64-32kbps) may have issues during the resampling process.
- *TODO:* Optimize the TXT to XML converter to calculate better start times for medleys
- *TODO:* Let users customize medleys
- *TODO:* Multiple language support (currently only English)
- *TODO:* Improve the audio conversion algorithm to get rid of MFAudio
- *TODO:* Reverse-engineer newer Singstar versions for Rap support
- *TODO:* Rewrite the BMP to TX2 algorithm for better artwork quality

## Credits
*Singstar Toolbox is partially based on the ancient Singstar Creator V3, which included several tools whose authors were not named.*

## Notes
It is possible to add more than 60 songs to a single disc, however the game might crash because of the excessive amount of artworks in menu.
